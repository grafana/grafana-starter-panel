# Simple React Panel

This is just a stub to show how you can create a basic visualization plugin.

First, install dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

To work with this plugin run:
```
yarn dev
```

or
```
yarn watch
```

This will run linting tools and apply prettier fix.


To build the plugin run:
```
yarn build
```
